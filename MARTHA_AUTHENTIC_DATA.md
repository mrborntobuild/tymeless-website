## 📝 Example of Good vs Bad Memory

**Bad (Generic):**
"I was a nurse during the war. It was hard work."

**Good (Authentic):**
"I was assigned to the 45th Field Hospital Unit in May 1944. We sailed from New York on the Queen Mary, which had been converted to a troopship. The crossing took five days, and I spent most of it seasick. When we arrived in England, we were stationed near Southampton. The first wounded came from the D-Day landings on June 6th. I will never forget that day - the hospital tents filled up within hours. We worked for 36 hours straight, and still, there were more coming."

The good version has:
- Specific unit (45th Field Hospital)
- Specific dates (May 1944, June 6th)
- Specific places (New York, Queen Mary, Southampton)
- Specific details (5-day crossing, seasick, 36-hour shifts)
- Emotional authenticity (never forget)

Martha will now respond based on these **real, detailed experiences** rather than generic knowledge! 🌹
